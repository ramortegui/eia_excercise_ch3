## Recursive function


#Excercise one 
#list_len

EiaPractice has two different recursive function to calculate the length of an array.

The first one list_len is a normal approach.
The second one tail_rec_len is a better approach called tail function calls, in order improve memory resources, as isn't using aditional memory.
list_len([1,2,3,4)]

#Exercise two
#range

EiaPractice has a function that receive a two integer and create a list of the values in the range.
range(1,3)

#Exercise three
#positives

Given an list of number, return a new list of positive numbers (recursive)

positives([1,2,-1,4])
